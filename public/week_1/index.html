<p>Today’s Materials: Paper, Tiles, Various Markers</p>
<h1>Sierpinski</h1>
<h3>Please take out a sheet of paper and pen and follow these instructions:</h3>
<h3>1. Draw an up-pointing, equilateral triangle that fills most of the page.</h3>
<h3>2. Lightly mark the center of each line of that triangle.</h3>
<h3>3. Draw lines between each of those marks, forming four triangles: three that point up, one that points down.</h3>
<h3>4. Find an empty, up-pointing triangle.</h3>
<h3>5. Go to instruction 2.</h3>
<h3>Yes, these instructions will go on forever, I’ll interrupt you in a minute.</h3>

<h1>Course Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Can the computer substitute for the Designer?</p>
<p>A: Probably, in some special cases, but usually the computer is an aid to the Designer.</p>

<p>This is a class about computational form, algorithmic image, generative art, procedural generation. In this class we will explore a creative process in which form is made by following defined processes. We will write instructions that a computer will follow to create images, animations, sounds, and sculptures. We will make things that make things.</p>

<h1>About this Class</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>In this class we will make things that make things. We will work with a variety of programming languages, tools, and methods to create a wide variety of output: graphics, sounds, videos, animations, even 3D printed objects. The primary goals of this class are to introduce new ways of making and to encourage aesthetic exploration.</p>
<h2>Class Format</h2>
<p>The first 10 weeks will focus on exploration. Each week we will introduce a new topic or tool, usually with an in-class workshop. Then, throughout the week you will be expected to post daily sketches/experiments related to that topic.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks of the course you will develop a final project with greater depth.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this class we will be exploring and creating projects in a variety of programming tools and languages, most of which will likely be new to you. To be comfortable in this class, you will need a foundation in a procedural programming language such as Javascript or Processing.</p>
<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to create a coded drawing project in Javascript or Processing from scratch or a template.</li>
<li>understand the basics of a version control system such as git.</li>
<li>be comfortable working in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</li>
<li>be comfortable capturing digital images with a camera and scanner.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, this class offers a good deal of flexibility. If you are not sure if you are ready for this class, please speak with me today to make a plan.</p>

<p>Our class blog will host your daily experiments and links to content of interest to the class.</p>
<h1>Assignments</h1>
<h2>Assignment 1 - Tile Sketches</h2>
<p>This is it, the first assignment and the beginning of your daily posts.</p>
<p>Daily exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a tile set</li>
<li>Use the tile set to create a design</li>
<li>Post your image to the class blog with the hashtag #tiles</li>
</ol>
<p>Explore a different idea every day, if you need some ideas consider using one of the following as a prompt: #paper, #pixels, #vectors, #typography, #self-portrait, #3d, #make-things, #hexagons, #triangles, #photocopier, #big, #huge, #edge, #corner, #pattern, #trade</p>
<h2>Assignment 2 - Research</h2>
<p>This week, in addition to your normal daily experiment posting, I’d like you to spend some time online looking at what others have done.</p>
<p>Find and explore web sites related to computational form and procedural generation. Post one link to the class blog every day this week. With each link posting include an image and a one sentence description of the site. Try to find a variety of links, and include hash tags below if applicable.</p>
<p>Tags: #artist, #tool, #language, #article, #book, #image, #video, #sound</p>
