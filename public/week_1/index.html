<p>Today’s Materials: Paper, Tiles, Various Markers</p>
<h1>Sierpinski</h1>
<p>Please take out a sheet of paper and pen and follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw an up-pointing, equilateral triangle that fills most of the page.</li>
<li>Lightly mark the center of each line of that triangle.</li>
<li>Draw lines between each of those marks, forming four triangles: three that point up, one that points down.</li>
<li>Find an empty, up-pointing triangle.</li>
<li>Go to instruction 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, these instructions will go on forever, I’ll interrupt you in a minute.</p>

<h1>Course Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Can the computer substitute for the Designer?</p>
<p>A: Probably, in some special cases, but usually the computer is an aid to the Designer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Charles Eames, Design Q&amp;A (<a href="http://www.markwunsch.com/eames.html">Transcript</a>)</p>
<p>This is a class about computational form, algorithmic image, generative art, procedural generation. In this class we will explore a creative process in which form is made by following defined processes. We will write instructions that a computer will follow to create images, animations, sounds, and sculptures. We will make things that make things.</p>

<h1>About this Class</h1>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>In this class we will make things that make things. We will work with a variety of programming languages, tools, and methods to create a wide variety of output: graphics, sounds, videos, animations, even 3D printed objects. The primary goals of this class are to introduce new ways of making and to encourage aesthetic exploration.</p>
<h2>Class Format</h2>
<p>The first 10 weeks will focus on exploration. Each week we will introduce a new topic or tool, usually with an in-class workshop. Then, throughout the week you will be expected to post daily sketches/experiments related to that topic.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks of the course you will develop a final project with greater depth.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this class we will be exploring and creating projects in a variety of programming tools and languages, most of which will likely be new to you. To be comfortable in this class, you will need a foundation in a procedural programming language such as Javascript or Processing.</p>
<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to create a coded drawing project in Javascript or Processing from scratch or a template.</li>
<li>understand the basics of a version control system such as git.</li>
<li>be comfortable working in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</li>
<li>be comfortable capturing digital images with a camera and scanner.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, this class offers a good deal of flexibility. If you are not sure if you are ready for this class, please speak with me today to make a plan.</p>
