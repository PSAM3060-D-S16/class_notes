# Sierpinski
Please take out a sheet of paper and pen and follow these instructions:

1. Draw an up-pointing, equilateral triangle that fills most of the page.
2. Lightly mark the center of each line of that triangle.
3. Draw lines between each of those marks, forming four triangles: three that point up, one that points down.
4. Find an empty, up-pointing triangle.
5. Go to instruction 2.

Yes, these instructions will go on forever, I'll interrupt you in a minute.

# Course Introduction

> Q: Can the computer substitute for the Designer?

> A: Probably, in some special cases, but usually the computer is an aid to the Designer.

This is a class about computational form, algorithmic image, generative art, procedural generation. In this class we will explore a creative process in which form is made by following defined processes. We will write instructions that a computer will follow to create images, animations, sounds, and sculptures. We will make things that make things.

# About this Class

## Learning Objectives
In this class we will make things that make things. We will work with a variety of programming languages, tools, and methods to create a wide variety of output: graphics, sounds, videos, animations, even 3D printed objects. The primary goals of this class are to introduce new ways of making and to encourage aesthetic exploration.


## Class Format

The first 10 weeks will focus on exploration. Each week we will introduce a new topic or tool, usually with an in-class workshop. Then, throughout the week you will be expected to post daily sketches/experiments related to that topic.

In the last few weeks of the course you will develop a final project with greater depth.


## Prerequisites
In this class we will be exploring and creating projects in a variety of programming tools and languages, most of which will likely be new to you. To be comfortable in this class, you will need a foundation in a procedural programming language such as Javascript or Processing.

You should:

- be able to create a coded drawing project in Javascript or Processing from scratch or a template.
- understand the basics of a version control system such as git.
- be comfortable working in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
- be comfortable capturing digital images with a camera and scanner.

That said, this class offers a good deal of flexibility. If you are not sure if you are ready for this class, please speak with me today to make a plan.
