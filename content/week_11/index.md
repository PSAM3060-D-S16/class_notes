# Week 11 - 3D Forms with OpenSCAD


## Realworld Examples

# OpenSCAD

### OpenSCAD is "The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller"

- Good for parametric parts
- Good for machine parts
- Not good for character models
- Think CAD and engineering
- Text based scripts, not GUI
- IDE shows code and renders output
- Exports to .stl for 3D printing, machining

- OpenSCAD is a declarative language. The focus is on describing the output rather than the process. This difference is pretty fundamental but may be subtle at first. Its something you have to get a feeling for.

- OpenSCAD looks kind of like Javascript/C, but it very different. That similarity can be confusing at first.


# Learning OpenSCAD

 http://www.openscad.org/

 OpenScad is pretty well [documented](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html).

 It has a complete user manual for the IDE and language, a very handy [cheat sheet](http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/index.html), and both written and video tutorials.

 I'm going to treat this class as a hands on introduction and quick tour of the basics.

 The cheat sheet does a great job of laying out what you can do with OpenSCAD. Here is what we will explore in class:

 - Making 3D Shapes
 - Transforming 3D Shapes
 - Boolean Operations
 - The Modifier Characters
 - Using Variables and Expressions

OpenSCAD goes further than this: it has the ability to structure with control statements and has a 2D subsystem. These are powerful tools, but the few things listed above are already enough to use OpenSCAD for many real, practical projects.
