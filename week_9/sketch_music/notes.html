<h1>Music Theory</h1>
<p>I don’t have a great deal of knowledge around music theory, so it is possible that some of the following may be incorrect. Still, these are the assumptions I used in creating the examples we will study this week.</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A piece of music is an organized collection of notes and rests.</li>
<li>A note is a tonal sound defined by it’s pitch, length, loudness, and timber.</li>
<li>A rest is a period of silence defined by it’s length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pitches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pitches of musical notes are constrained to a repeating, exponential 12 note grid.</li>
<li>Each note in the grid is 2^1/12 or 1.059 times higher than the last.</li>
<li>After 12 notes the pitch will double, this is called and octave.</li>
<li>These notes are named [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C#&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D#&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;F#&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G#&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A#&quot;, “B”]</li>
<li>You could also call “C#” &quot;D-Flat&quot;. They are the same thing. Except when they are totally not.</li>
<li>The distance between two adjacent notes is called a half-step. Two half-steps is a whole-step.</li>
<li>The fourth octave “A” note is often used as a tuning standard, and is often set at 440hz.</li>
<li>Side Note: 12 steps is a compromise that allows each step to be equal, but results in intervals between pitches that are close to integer ratios.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scales:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could use all of the notes when writing music, but most music picks a subset of notes to stick too.</li>
<li>These subsets of notes are called keys.</li>
<li>Keys have a tonic, which is the note that the key is built from.</li>
<li>Keys have a scale, which describes the intervals from the tonic to the other notes in the scale.</li>
<li>For example the major scale intervals are [whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half]</li>
<li>So, C Major is C, then two half-steps up, two half-steps up, one half-step up, etc.</li>
<li>There are very many different scales. Major and minor are pretty common.</li>
<li>The mood of music is tied to the scales. Major is happy. Minor is sad. It is kind of crazy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rhythm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rhythm</li>
<li>4/4 time</li>
<li>beats per measure</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
